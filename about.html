    <h2>Why I want to go to Italy.</h2>
</div>
<p>I have always wanted to travel around the world. Growing up and not having the opportunity to get to go on family vacays often, I would usually hop onto google maps to explore that yearning feeling to experience what it would like to be like to see another country from my perspective, with spending hours clicking on different areas of the map I came across one inparticular that caught my eye. It was Italy. I did not know a thing about the country, however, 11 year old me wanted to go there from the moment I saw it on my computer screen, from the pretty buildings and the rivers that go through the cities and the difference in cultural from my own country, I really wanted to go. The more I see on social media of the food choices, scenery, aesthetically pleasing villas and cafes to visit and try their yummy pasteries or drinks, the people, and the fan favourite-for me- in Crema, located in Northern Italy for as that is where my favourite book and movie is based: Call Me By Your Name. Regardless Italy is on my bucklist for places to visit for a long time and I am going to go even if it empties my entire life savings.</p>
